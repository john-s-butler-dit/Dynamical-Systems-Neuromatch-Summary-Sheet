This repository contains the latex code to generate the Dynamical Systems Summary Sheets for [Neuromatch Academy Computational Neuroscience Summer School 2022](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html)

The code is divided by day:
+ Linear Systems (W2D2)
+ Biological Neuron Models (W2D3)
+ Dynamic Networks (W2D4)

with the figures in the FIGURES folder.
